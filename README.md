## Sentiment Analysis
###What is sentiment analysis? <br>

Sentiment analysis is the process by which we use statistical techniques in order to gauge/understand opinions and sentiment of a piece of text. <br>

###Example: Movie Reviews  <br>
• Unbelievably disappointing, directors should kill themselves  <br>
• Amazing movie, great plot twist and action scenes!  <br>
• Wow Nicholas Cage is really bad  <br>
